I was bored in a traditional gym setting, so I explored my options and found a local martial arts gym that offered strength and conditioning classes (similar to UFC GYM’s [Daily Ultimate Training](https://ufcgym.com/classes/daily-ultimate-training-d-u-t)). I tried a class and immediately signed up for a membership. I loved the diversity and challenge of training with different training apparatus like kettlebells, sledgehammers, and battle ropes. While participating in strength and conditioning classes, I always observed the different martial arts classes that were happening simultaneously on the mats on the other side of the gym and decided one day to hop into that class instead.

Your arms will become toned from the persistent punching, your abs will become flat and defined from the constant core rotation, and your thighs, calves, and glutes will be strengthened from your stance and constant leg movement. Boxing will increase your metabolism, muscle mass, endurance, coordination, and ability to withstand fatigue.

After the back to back pregnancies of my son and daughter, I weighed only 112 pounds at 5’9” and was completely frail, depleted, and exhausted. I was bored in a traditional gym setting, so I explored my options and found a local martial arts gym that offered strength and conditioning classes (similar to UFC GYM’s <a href="https://ufcgym.com/classes/daily-ultimate-training-d-u-t">Daily Ultimate Training</a>). I tried a class and immediately signed up for a membership. I loved the diversity and challenge of training with different training apparatus like kettlebells, sledgehammers, and battle ropes. While participating in strength and conditioning classes, I always observed the different martial arts classes that were happening simultaneously on the mats on the other side of the gym and decided one day to hop into that class instead. It was boxing, and I was HOOKED! My venture as a woman in the world of mixed martial arts was born. While the reasons why I think boxing is the best workout for women are endless, here are my top three:</p>\n<h2>1. You will get in the best shape of your life</h2>\n<p><a href="https://ufcgym.com/classes/boxing-conditioning">Boxing</a> works every single muscle in your body. Your arms will become toned from the persistent punching, your abs will become flat and defined from the constant core rotation, and your thighs, calves, and glutes will be strengthened from your stance and constant leg movement. Boxing will increase your metabolism, muscle mass, endurance, coordination, and ability to withstand fatigue. You can burn anywhere from 500 to over 1000 calories in a single 50-minute session and will continue to burn fat for the rest of the day!</p>\n<h2>2.

Cardio Killer\n-----------------\n\n[UFC GYM Kickboxing Conditioning](https://ufcgym.com/classes/kickboxing-conditioning) gives me the best cardio workout. The class movements utilize your legs which require the most energy to use. Kicking hard and fast in multiple classes a week has vastly improved my cardiovascular health and endurance. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather improve my cardio strength from hitting the bags with a high energy group than spend 30 minutes on the treadmill!\n\n2\\. A Mind/Body Workout\n-----------------------\n\nKickboxing Conditioning class uses multiple muscle groups at once. This helps with coordination, timing, precision, and flexibility. Using your legs and feet to strike with, while holding form in your upper body, requires your mind to control your entire body to move as one. This mind body connection has helped me improve my overall fitness ability from Kickboxing Conditioning class and beyond.\n\n3\\. Self Defense Techniques\n---------------------------\n\nIn addition to knowing I will always be hit with a challenge, Kickboxing Conditioning class teaches multiple self-defense techniques. UFC GYM Coaches are great about teaching proper form. Throughout my training at UFC GYM Costa Mesa, I have learned how to properly hit the bag with by hands, elbows, legs, and feet, improving my overall self-defense techniques and confidence.\n\n4\\. The Ultimate Challenge\n--------------------------\n\nWe all know Kickboxing Conditioning is a challenge for your body, but it also challenges and sharpens the mind. By having class equipment to be aware of, proper technique and form to hold, while constantly training and being required to attain different combos, you are constantly engaging your mind to remember and think as quickly as you execute.\n\nOverall, I would recommend UFC GYM's Kickboxing Conditioning program because of the benefits it brings to your mind and body, the high caliber of Coaches, and the improvements you will see in your body from this training.

Such wide-ranging modalities of free weights include kettlebells, dumbbells, TRX rip and suspension trainers, Bulgarian bags, Plyo boxes, Concept 2 rowers, barbells, jump ropes, treadmills, assault bikes, sleds, bands, sand bags, medicine balls, battle ropes and much more!!

I can’t think of a better way to burn 750 to 1000 calories in an hour while simultaneously get aggression out (without getting punched in the face). The class starts off with a ten-minute dynamic warm up, leads into seven three minute rounds of kickboxing combinations with active rest in between, and finishes off with a 10-minute cool down consisting of ab exercises and static stretching. \n\nHere are four essential kickboxing moves that will help you maximize your outcome in class:\n\n1\\. Stance\n----------\n\nTo throw correct punches and kicks, you need to first make sure you are in a proper stance. Separate your feet about shoulder width apart. Pull your dominant leg back and out into a staggered stance at about a 45 degree angle. Distribute your weight evenly between your feet, keep your heels off the ground, knees slightly bent, and stay light on your toes. Keep your hands up to protect your chin and elbows in to protect your body, while keeping your chin down. Every movement should begin and end in your stance.\n\n2\\. Punch\n---------\n\nThe six basic punches you will need to know are called in the following numbers:\n\n1- Jab\n\n2- Cross\n\n3- Lead hook\n\n4- Rear hook\n\n5- Lead uppercut\n\n6- Rear uppercut\n\nJab- The jab is used to find your range and set up other punches. Starting from your stance, slightly lift your lead foot. As the weight comes back down, throw your lead fist straight out in front of you, rotating your palm so that it faces the ground upon extension. Snap it back to your face the same way it came out, quickly.\n\nCross- The cross can be used as a power punch, to counter punch a jab, or to set up another punch. Starting in your stance, throw your rear hand from your chin across the body and towards your target in a straight line. Your shoulders should rotate 180 degrees and torso and hips should rotate counter clockwise. Keep your lead hand retracted and tucked against your face to protect your precious face! Transfer your weight from your rear foot to your lead foot, turning your rear heel outwards and causing the foot to end on its toes. Retract your cross quickly, along the same path it came back into your stance.\n\n Hooks- If used properly, the hook can be one of the most powerful punches. Since it approaches from the side, it’s hard for your opponent to see it coming. Rotate your whole body by pivoting your hips in the same direction as the hook you are throwing. Have your elbow come up, bent at a 90-degree angle as you throw your fist towards your target, and keep it high as you follow through. Keep your fist is in a thumbs-up position to protect from injury and always keep your other hand up by your face. Retract by rotating your body back into the same position it came from, into your fight stance.\n\nUppercuts- Uppercuts are usually thrown when you are in close range to your target. They can be sneaky and are usually aimed at the body or chin. From your stance, start the punch from your jaw and make an upwards scooping motion, aiming for your target. Throw your hip forward to add more power. Retract your punch along the same path that you threw it out, ending up back in your stance.\n\n3\\. Kick\n--------\n\nKicking is my all-time favorite move! While kicking, keep in mind that kicking power comes from your hip and body rotation, not your leg. To throw a rear kick start in your fight stance. Pivot your lead leg onto the ball of the foot and open up the rear hip. As your hip opens, swing your rear leg and point the rear knee toward your target as you pivot. Your right hip should fully rotate over the left hip while you swing your body, leaving your kicking leg’s hip in a parallel position over the hip of your base leg. Connect with your shin (not foot!) to prevent injury. Once you’ve made contact, quickly bring your leg back into your stance.\n\n4\\. Knee\n--------\n\nKnees are great to throw when in close proximity to your opponent. They can be devastating. Bring the knee up while simultaneously thrusting your hips forward, extending your knee directly penetrating the target. You may grab either side of the bag or onto the back of your opponent’s neck and skull in a clinch to gain momentum and pull them into your knee strike.\n\nIf you want to blast fat, destress, get a full body workout, and learn a new skill, [try a UFC GYM Kickboxing Conditioning](https://ufcgym.com/get-a-guest-pass) class today!\n\n[![2054-18-Blog Photos Q1--06-1.jpg](https://blog.ufcgym.com/hs-fs/hubfs/2054-18-Blog%20Photos%20Q1--06-1.jpg?width=845&height=224&name=2054-18-Blog%20Photos%20Q1--06-1.jpg)  \n](https://ufcgym.com/get-a-guest-pass)",html:'<p><a href="https://ufcgym.com">UFC GYM</a>’s <a href="https://ufcgym.com/classes/kickboxing-conditioning">Kickboxing Conditioning class</a> is a high intensity, strategic workout that is always evolving and never gets old. I can’t think of a better way to burn 750 to 1000 calories in an hour while simultaneously get aggression out (without getting punched in the face). The class starts off with a ten-minute dynamic warm up, leads into seven three minute rounds of kickboxing combinations with active rest in between, and finishes off with a 10-minute cool down consisting of ab exercises and static stretching.</p>\n<p>Here are four essential kickboxing moves that will help you maximize your outcome in class:</p>\n<h2>1. Stance</h2>\n<p>To throw correct punches and kicks, you need to first make sure you are in a proper stance. Separate your feet about shoulder width apart. Pull your dominant leg back and out into a staggered stance at about a 45 degree angle. Distribute your weight evenly between your feet, keep your heels off the ground, knees slightly bent, and stay light on your toes. Keep your hands up to protect your chin and elbows in to protect your body, while keeping your chin down. Every movement should begin and end in your stance.</p>\n<h2>2. Punch</h2>\n<p>The six basic punches you will need to know are called in the following numbers:</p>\n<p>1- Jab</p>\n<p>2- Cross</p>\n<p>3- Lead hook</p>\n<p>4- Rear hook</p>\n<p>5- Lead uppercut</p>\n<p>6- Rear uppercut</p>\n<p>Jab- The jab is used to find your range and set up other punches. Starting from your stance, slightly lift your lead foot. As the weight comes back down, throw your lead fist straight out in front of you, rotating your palm so that it faces the ground upon extension. Snap it back to your face the same way it came out, quickly.</p>\n<p>Cross- The cross can be used as a power punch, to counter punch a jab, or to set up another punch. Starting in your stance, throw your rear hand from your chin across the body and towards your target in a straight line. Your shoulders should rotate 180 degrees and torso and hips should rotate counter clockwise. Keep your lead hand retracted and tucked against your face to protect your precious face! Transfer your weight from your rear foot to your lead foot, turning your rear heel outwards and causing the foot to end on its toes. Retract your cross quickly, along the same path it came back into your stance.</p>\n<p>Hooks- If used properly, the hook can be one of the most powerful punches. Since it approaches from the side, it’s hard for your opponent to see it coming. Rotate your whole body by pivoting your hips in the same direction as the hook you are throwing. Have your elbow come up, bent at a 90-degree angle as you throw your fist towards your target, and keep it high as you follow through. Keep your fist is in a thumbs-up position to protect from injury and always keep your other hand up by your face. Retract by rotating your body back into the same position it came from, into your fight stance.</p>\n<p>Uppercuts- Uppercuts are usually thrown when you are in close range to your target. They can be sneaky and are usually aimed at the body or chin. From your stance, start the punch from your jaw and make an upwards scooping motion, aiming for your target. Throw your hip forward to add more power. Retract your punch along the same path that you threw it out, ending up back in your stance.</p>\n<h2>3. Kick</h2>\n<p>Kicking is my all-time favorite move! While kicking, keep in mind that kicking power comes from your hip and body rotation, not your leg. To throw a rear kick start in your fight stance. Pivot your lead leg onto the ball of the foot and open up the rear hip. As your hip opens, swing your rear leg and point the rear knee toward your target as you pivot. Your right hip should fully rotate over the left hip while you swing your body, leaving your kicking leg’s hip in a parallel position over the hip of your base leg. Connect with your shin (not foot!) to prevent injury. Once you’ve made contact, quickly bring your leg back into your stance.</p>\n<h2>4. Knee</h2>\n<p>Knees are great to throw when in close proximity to your opponent. They can be devastating. Bring the knee up while simultaneously thrusting your hips forward, extending your knee directly penetrating the target. You may grab either side of the bag or onto the back of your opponent’s neck and skull in a clinch to gain momentum and pull them into your knee strike.</p>\n<p>If you want to blast fat, destress, get a full body workout, and learn a new skill, <a href="https://ufcgym.com/get-a-guest-pass">try a UFC GYM Kickboxing Conditioning</a> class today!</p>\n<p><a href="https://ufcgym.com/get-a-guest-pass"><img src="https://blog.ufcgym.com/hs-fs/hubfs/2054-18-Blog%20Photos%20Q1--06-1.jpg?width=845&amp;height=224&amp;name=2054-18-Blog%20Photos%20Q1--06-1.jpg" alt="2054-18-Blog Photos Q1--06-1.jpg"><br>\n</a></p>\n',attributes:{title:"Essential Moves in a Kickboxing Class",author:"Shanie Rusth",tags:"workout",banner:"https://ufcgymweb.blob.core.windows.net/ufcgym-web/news/2018-02-19-essential-moves-in-a-kickboxing-class-banner.jpg",_meta:{resourcePath:"C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\personal-work\\Shoan\\data\\articles\\2018-02-19-essential-moves-in-a-kickboxing-class.md"}}}},697:function(e,t){e.exports={body:'[HIIT classes](https://ufcgym.com/functional-fitness), which stands for High Intensity Interval Training, have become one of the most popular methods of training in recent years. It focuses on pushing participants to their maximum effort level for short periods of time followed by recovery…then repeat, repeat, repeat. Despite its meteoric rise in popularity with millennials and young Gen-X’ers, it can still resonate as an intimidating workout with those who are just getting started in a fitness routine or have never trained at such a high intensity. The good news is, you don’t have to already come prepared with a chiseled hard body or years of exercise experience to get the most out of HIIT classes. HIIT is about pushing people safely towards their physical limits which vary from person to person. Here are some great reasons you should try a HIIT class:\n\n1\\. Shorter Workouts\n--------------------\n\nI mean, who isn’t already sold right there? HIIT workouts are a huge timesaver because you are working at a much higher intensity which means you are expending more energy, a.k.a calories, at a faster rate than a sustained cardio workout. It is possible to burn more calories in 15 minutes of a HIIT class than almost an hour of jogging. And if you’re pressed for time, you don’t have to sacrifice results when time is an issue. It’s a huge win-win!\n\n2\\. Boosts Metabolism\n---------------------\n\nAlright, if we didn’t convince you with the first reason, who doesn’t want a stronger metabolism? Since your body is using more energy during a HIIT class, you deplete your oxygen levels more rapidly than a traditional cardio workout. This means that your body is forced to recovery at a quicker, more efficient rate which also forces your body to produce HGH (Human Growth Hormone). HGH not only affects your metabolism, but also plays a role in muscle recovery helping you feel ready to tackle your next workout.\n\n3\\. Lose Fat, Not Muscle\n------------------------\n\nThe misconception that building muscle means looking bulky unfortunately still exists in some minds, but don’t believe the hype! Steady state cardio makes it much more difficult to maintain muscle gains. With HIIT workouts, there is an opportunity to use a variety of equipment to increase strength gains and build lean muscle which keeps your metabolism functioning efficiently, not to mention looks great naked!\n\n4\\. The "After Burn"\n--------------------\n\nEnough said. High intensity interval training promotes a much longer “after burn”, also known as EPOC or Excess Post-Oxygen Consumption. But what does that really mean? Simply put, it’s the amount of oxygen your body consumes after your workout to regulate itself back to its normal resting state. Exercise that consumes more oxygen burns more calories both during and after.\n\n5\\. It\'s Tough\n--------------\n\nMake no mistake, HIIT class is a challenge! This workout is definitely NOT synonymous with boredom. While a HIIT workout can test personal limits both physically and mentally, it also has benefits that for many outweigh any evidence science has to offer…it makes you feel like a warrior!\n\nThe list of benefits for HIIT goes on and on. If these top 5 haven’t swayed you, then perhaps knowing it can help build a healthier heart or increase endurance will excite you. Perhaps what also makes it great is knowing that HIIT can be done with or without equipment, alone or with a group. However, one of the most successful ways to stay committed and motivated with your workout routine is to workout in a group. There are a multitude of options out there to try, so finding a great class can be more challenging than it seems.

I thought being skinny was what being “healthy” and “fit” was. I would force myself to do endless amounts of hours of cardio to burn off the food I ate that day because I was scared of gaining weight.

At this time, I was also introduced to body building and weightlifting in the gym. At first, I was so scared of what others would think of me in the weight room. I was scared people would think I was weak or performing certain exercises wrong. Eventually after a couple of weeks, I didn’t care anymore about other people’s opinions. I gave it my all every day and I saw results that I had never seen before in the past. I finally had something to be proud of.

I had only taken Boxing class a few times in my life, but after seeing a class that was going on during my first visit to the gym, I felt the urge to give it another go. I am currently getting ready to compete in my first bikini competition on June 2nd, 2018. My training involves a body building/ strength training split and I also need to be incorporating cardio into my workout regimen 3-4 times a week. The stair master (as I’m sure some of you know) can get super boring! I figured boxing training would be a really great alternative some days when I just feel like getting my cardio done in a more exciting and hands on way! UFC GYM offers a killer class called [Kickboxing Conditioning](https://ufcgym.com/classes/kickboxing-conditioning). It’s an amazing total body workout to tone your body (while burning some serious calories!). You do not need to be a “pro” at kickboxing in order to enjoy this class. It was so much fun and a lot of the drills that you are doing are basic functional movements… we did A LOT of squats during my first class! Before the class, the coach makes sure you are all set with your hand wraps, and if you’ve never put hand wraps on before they will make sure they are put on properly so your hands are comfortable throughout the class. The class had a really great combination of everything. My whole body was exhausted after! Aside from practicing some different techniques with the bag, we also did a ton of different core work which was great. The coaches really make sure that your using correct form and they take the time to go over the different techniques and combinations the class will be performing. My first class was incredible and definitely made me want to continue trying to get better with the [kickboxing techniques](https://ufcgym.com/classes/kickboxing-skills-and-techniques) and challenge my body in ways that it normally is not used to. I’m so glad that I’ve found UFC GYM because it allows me to incorporate different styles of training into my normal routine. It is so much fun to switch things up! My body definitely liked the challenge and now I am eager to get better and have another hobby aside from just strength training/bodybuilding.\n\nI challenge you to step out of your comfort zone and [try out a Kickboxing Conditioning class](https://ufcgym.com/get-a-guest-pass) at UFC GYM! You will not be disappointed. I know sometimes its hard to take that initial step and do something you’ve never done before, but I’m telling you, the feeling afterwards is such an accomplished and rewarding feeling. Everyone at UFC GYM makes you feel like you’re at home, they really do treat you like family and genuinely care about your success and are 100% willing to work with you on weaknesses and helping you excel.

[Kickboxing Conditioning](https://ufcgym.com/classes/kickboxing-conditioning) at [UFC GYM](https://ufcgym.com) is a high intensity workout.  Here are some things to consider when deciding what and when to eat before a full body, high-intensity workout:\n\n*   When was the last time you ate?\n*   Do you have a body composition goal – such as losing body fat or gaining muscle?\n*   What gives you the highest energy levels during your workouts?\n\nWhen it comes to training at a high level, carbohydrates are king. Not enough can result in early physical and mental fatigue, low blood sugar levels, and related symptoms such as dizziness. Obviously, you don’t want blood sugar to drop, and you don’t want to send your body into a catabolic state. You’ve got some options depending on your schedule, lifestyle and what agrees with your body during workouts:\n\n*   Consume a balanced meal 2-4 hours before intense workouts like Kickboxing Conditioning. This would include carbohydrate rich foods like rice or potatoes with your favorite lean protein and veggies. You can also add some healthy fats from nuts, plant oils or avocado. As a general rule, the more time you have before workout, the larger the meal can be.\n*   Another option is to have a fast digesting, smaller meal right before your workouts. If your goal is to gain build muscle, you can do this in addition to a normal meal 2-4 hours beforehand. Here are some options:\n\n### **MEAL OPTION 1:**\n\nSmoothie with your favorite fruit/veggies and protein power.

Not enough can result in early physical and mental fatigue, low blood sugar levels, and related symptoms such as dizziness. Obviously, you don’t want blood sugar to drop, and you don’t want to send your body into a catabolic state. You’ve got some options depending on your schedule, lifestyle and what agrees with your body during workouts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consume a balanced meal 2-4 hours before intense workouts like Kickboxing Conditioning. This would include carbohydrate rich foods like rice or potatoes with your favorite lean protein and veggies. You can also add some healthy fats from nuts, plant oils or avocado. As a general rule, the more time you have before workout, the larger the meal can be.</li>\n<li>Another option is to have a fast digesting, smaller meal right before your workouts. If your goal is to gain build muscle, you can do this in addition to a normal meal 2-4 hours beforehand. Here are some options:</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>MEAL OPTION 1:</strong></h3>\n<p>Smoothie with your favorite fruit/veggies and protein power. Use milk or water depending on calorie needs.</p>\n<h3><strong>MEAL OPTION 2:</strong></h3>\n<p>PB&amp;J paired with an apple or banana</p>\n<h3><strong>MEAL OPTION 3:</strong></h3>\n<p>Sports bar with at least a 2:1 ratio of carbs to protein and minimal fat</p>\n<p>If you’re pressed for time and can’t eat before an intense workout, consider a sports drink (6-8% carbohydrates with electrolytes) to keep your blood sugar and hydration levels up.

But have you challenged yourself in terms of your diet and nutrition lately? We are challenging you to a minimum 7-day added sugar detox. You can do this challenge for the minimum 7 days and still see improvement, or you can be a rock star and stick it out for the 21 days to really make a difference!\n\n#### The maximum amount of added sugars recommendation for one day according to the [American Heart Association](http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.WsJ5U8aZOlN), is no more than 9 teaspoons (or 37.5grams) per day for Men, and no more than 6 teaspoons (or 25 grams) for women.  To put it into perspective, in one 12- ounce can of regular soda there are about 8 teaspoons of added sugar, give or take, which is about 130 calories with no other nutrients. There are over 61 different names for sugar, which hide in packaged and processed foods! Even if you do not eat dessert, you may still be consuming more than the recommended amount each day. These common names for sugar often ends in -ose, or says syrup, but these added sugars can show up in multiple ways on one package. Consuming too much sugar can wreak havoc on the body, pack on the pounds, decrease immunity, disturb cognitive function, alter hormones, and increase chronic disease risk.\n\n#### This added sugar reset challenge is ridding your body from the added sugars, and the goal is to make you more aware of the added sugars hiding in products such as salad dressings, condiments, nut butters, crackers, yogurt, breads, cereals, protein bars, drinks, "light" and "fat free" items, etc. This "reset-challenge" is different from the rest, because it is just eliminating added sugars which the body does not need. In comparison, a juice cleanse requires you to eliminate much more from your diet. The idea is not to deprive you of your favorite foods forever, but just to make you more aware of the high amount of added sugars in your diet so after the reset, you will likely be more sensitive and consume less added sugars in your everyday life!

A common complaint among those trying to build muscle is having to eat continuously. Drinking those calories in the amounts and ratios desired is a simple fix to this issue. Youth athletes can also benefit from these to prevent weight loss while in season or as rapidly digesting pre-workout fuel.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Mocha Mint <a href="https://www.dotfit.com/content-1671.html">https://www.dotfit.com/content-1671.html</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Strawberry Chocolate Smash <a href="https://www.dotfit.com/content-1672.html">https://www.dotfit.com/content-1672.html</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recovery</h3>\n<h4>For recovery, liquid nutrition offers an effective way to get nutrients quickly into the body to help with muscle repair and prevent soreness.

I can 100% relate. Before I made health and fitness not only my number one priority but a lifestyle, I had absolutely no idea what my body needed nutrition wise to not only look its best, but feel and perform its best as well. As someone who used to struggle with disordered eating, food was always the enemy. I used to have body image issues and this led me down a dangerous path when it came to eating patterns. I used to eat the bare minimum in order to stay “tiny” because that’s what I thought being fit was.\n\nLooking back, I wish I had someone to help me and direct me when it came to living a healthy lifestyle. Thankfully I was able to understand that the overall body and lifestyle I wanted to achieve was NOT going to come from under eating. I knew I needed to make a change, but I was scared and honestly just didn’t know what steps I needed to take in order to change my relationship with food. At this point in time I changed my major in college to Health Sciences & Wellness Management. I had started taking classes on nutrition and did my own research at home outside of school to educate myself more so I could not only help myself, but help give knowledge to others as well.\n\nAt this point, I finally felt like I was eating properly and giving my body what it needed after neglecting my relationship with food for over a year prior. Its absolutely crazy to see how your body adapts and performs when its being given the fuel it needs to grow and thrive in the gym and outside of the gym.\n\nWhen it comes to counting calories and macros, as a beginner I 100% understand how difficult and confusing it may seem. I also know how stressful it can get having to worry about counting macros and calories as well. I honestly love to have structure when it comes to my food intake, mainly to make sure I am eating enough to get the most out of training, so counting calories and macros is like second nature to me. I also love the idea of intuitive eating, listening to what our bodies need and when they feel our best is something I definitely pay attention to. Having a baseline of what your calories and macros should be while eating intuitively is absolutely possible.\n\nA full day of eating for me looks something like this: I make sure I am having balanced meals throughout the day. A typical meal for me would be a protein source, a carbohydrate source, and a fat source. For example, for breakfast I will typically have either whole eggs or egg whites as my protein source, a bowl of oatmeal for my carbohydrate source, and half an avocado or a tablespoon of peanut butter as my healthy fat source. I will usually always lay my meals out this way if I am not tracking macros at that point in time to still ensure I am getting a proper intake of each macronutrient source with each meal.\n\nTo break up the day a bit, I will normally have a snack 2 hours after each meal. This will also help to keep your metabolism firing and consistently burning throughout the day. Eating every 2-3 hours is great because your body will constantly have something to burn and your metabolism will need to work harder to keep up with the intake of food!\n\nAnother factor into our nutrition is WATER. WATER IS HUGE! I believe a lot of people underestimate how important it is to be drinking enough water. Its pretty crazy because we as humans are made up of about 60% of water. Drinking water is vital for almost every function in the body. Water helps flush out toxins, boost our mood, enhance our performance in the gym, prevents headaches and more! The list seriously goes on and on. Depending on your activity level determines how much water you should be drinking. The average person should be drinking half their body weight in ounces of water a day. For me since I train typically 5-6 days a week and am a very active person, I will drink 1 gallon of water throughout the day. At first it seemed pretty hard to drink all this water, but it seriously has improved my performance in the gym and has made me feel all around better mood wise and energy wise.\n\nHere are three simple steps that you guys can make to improve your nutrition and live an overall healthier lifestyle:\n\n1) Prepare food for the week ahead. Cooking your meals in bulk will help you have food ready and on hand when you have a busy day ahead! This way you wont be left with the issue of either skipping meals, or finding yourself hungry with nothing on hand!\n\n2) Always reach for the better option. Let’s say you can either grab a bag of chips or a protein bar, grab the protein bar! It’s a source of protein and you will ultimately feel more full from a protein bar rather than a bag of chips that will most likely still leave you hungry.\n\n 3) At the end of the day, intuitive eating may not be for everyone and not one specific diet will not work for everyone. Being self aware about what works specifically for you and your body is huge. Maybe you are someone who likes structure, this is where I would recommend counting calories and macros in order for you to stay on top of your nutrient and understand what is in the foods you are consuming. If you are someone who feels that kind of structure would stress you out worrying about numbers I would recommend eating intuitively while still being aware of the foods you are eating and portion control.\n\nAt the end of the day, we are all striving to find a diet/ eating approach that fits our lifestyle and allows us to still feel like we have freedom when it comes to food. Finding the correct diet/ nutritional plan isn’t always going to be easy and we have to understand that we may have to try multiple approach’s in order for us to find the one that works best! Once we accept that this is a process of trial and error, we then can shift our mindset from trying to find the “quick fix” to forever trusting the process of a life long fitness journey.",html:"<p>Have you ever felt completely lost when it comes to nutrition and how we should be nourishing our bodies?

It is not a one size fits all formula, but there are a few basics for everyone to keep in mind.  The truth is, there is no magic fix to working out and dieting- small changes are key for long term results, and you really cannot out exercise a poor diet! Overall, performance comes down to not only diet, but lifestyle factors as well! At [UFC GYM](https://ufcgym.com), we are committed to offering you [classes](https://ufcgym.com/functional-fitness) that will challenge you and help you reach your fitness goals. But it doesn’t stop at the gym, it is important to fuel your body with proper nutrition to maximize your performance and allow you to get the most of your classes. Let’s break it down:\n\nTip #1: Think of Food as Fuel\n-----------------------------\n\n#### Pre and post workout meals are important in ensuring adequate performance- be sure to incorporate ALL food groups including lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, dairy, beans, legumes, nuts and seeds\n\n### **Pre-workout (About 45 min. to max 3 hrs**):\n\n#### Focus on carbohydrates (ex: grains, fruit, honey) with a small amount of protein (ex: chicken, eggs, peanut butter). It shouldn\'t be too heavy of a meal, especially closer to 45 minutes out.\n\n##### **Example meal-** Banana and peanut butter, yogurt and fruit, rice cake and almond butter, hard boiled egg and a Clementine, oatmeal and a few nuts, 1/2 c grapes and 10 almonds\n\n### During workout:\n\n#### Stay Hydrated! Long periods of endurance training will require more carbohydrates, and may even require some refueling with simple carbohydrate sources during the workout.\n\n### Immediate post workout snack:\n\n#### Focus on simple carbohydrate such as a small piece of fruit until you get your actual meal in, and don’t forget your [DotFit aminos](https://www.dotfit.com/Store)!\n\n### **Post-workout (1 hr. to max 2 hrs**):\n\n#### You want to focus on protein (aim for minimum 25 grams). Additionally, now is when you can add in some healthy fats and grains.\n\n##### **Example meal:** 3-4 oz grilled chicken breast, 1/2c sweet potato, 1/2 c spinach and 1/3 of an avocado.\n\nTip #2: Think of Supplementation as an Insurance Plan\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n#### While I always promote food first, supplements can be a back-up to fill in any nutritional gaps for optimal health. For example, if you do not eat 2-3 servings of fatty fish per week, a fish oil supplement can be beneficial for you. A multivitamin and probiotics are also great to fill in those nutritional gaps and get your gut health back on track. For athletic performance, amino acids can be helpful for performance and recovery, and can be consumed before, during, and after workouts! Depending on your specific needs, you may also need protein, calcium, etc. for your specific needs and goals.\n\nTip #3: Hydration is Key\n------------------------\n\n#### Hydration is extremely important in addition to diet, and specific needs for athletes depends on the variability in sweat rates for each person. Before working out, ensure you are hydrated. A good way to calculate how much you need to rehydrate is to weigh yourself before working out. Then after your workout, weigh yourself again. Typically, any "weight loss" in that time is actually water loss- so that is how much you need to rehydrate. Every 2.2 pounds lost is generally about 1 liter.\n\nTip #4: Reset to Maximize Recovery\n----------------------------------\n\n#### Sleep is crucial! You recover in your sleep, and an adequate amount of sleep can help prevent soreness so you are ready to crush your next workout! Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n\n#### Overall, it is a bit of a balancing act, and sometimes getting in an adequate amount of nutrition requires some planning. These are some basic and crucial ways to maximize your performance, whether you are a beginning in the gym, to an athlete- to take you one step forward. So, next time you head to [UFC GYM](https://ufcgym.com), make sure you’ve fueled your body with the right foods that will give you the energy you need, you are hydrated, and fully rested.

Depending on your specific needs, you may also need protein, calcium, etc. for your specific needs and goals.</h4>\n<h2>Tip #3: Hydration is Key</h2>\n<h4>Hydration is extremely important in addition to diet, and specific needs for athletes depends on the variability in sweat rates for each person. Before working out, ensure you are hydrated. A good way to calculate how much you need to rehydrate is to weigh yourself before working out. Then after your workout, weigh yourself again. Typically, any &quot;weight loss&quot; in that time is actually water loss- so that is how much you need to rehydrate. Every 2.2 pounds lost is generally about 1 liter.</h4>\n<h2>Tip #4: Reset to Maximize Recovery</h2>\n<h4>Sleep is crucial! You recover in your sleep, and an adequate amount of sleep can help prevent soreness so you are ready to crush your next workout! Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.</h4>\n<h4>Overall, it is a bit of a balancing act, and sometimes getting in an adequate amount of nutrition requires some planning. These are some basic and crucial ways to maximize your performance, whether you are a beginning in the gym, to an athlete- to take you one step forward. So, next time you head to <a href="https://ufcgym.com">UFC GYM</a>, make sure you’ve fueled your body with the right foods that will give you the energy you need, you are hydrated, and fully rested.

MMA has been an integral part of my life and shaped me into the woman I am today. My first experience on the mats was as a teenager, as a sophomore in highschool. My older neighbors were high school wrestlers and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners and their garage was matted out into a makeshift training room. I used to skateboard past their house every day and watch them grapple and I begged them to teach me and let me train with them. It took a few months of convincing, but finally they let me in. Before I knew it, my dad was paying the boys to teach me private lessons. This training sparked my love for mixed martial arts and I have continued to train in the sport since. In my opinion, every woman should practice [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu](https://ufcgym.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu) at UFC GYM, and here are a few reasons why.\n\nEmpowerment\n-----------\n\nDo you have any idea how good it feels to physically stand your own against a man more than double your size? Jiu Jitsu was designed to use technique to overcome brute strength. A weaker and smaller opponent can dominate the big tough guy by using technique alone. Jiu Jitsu is the perfect sport for women, because we can use our body mechanisms to dominate our opponents, regardless of their strength and size. You don’t need to be big or strong to be good at it. BJJ teaches situational awareness, and how to properly disable and escape an attacker in a real-world defense situation. The scary fact is that 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted in the US. I love having the peace of mind, knowing that I am a 130 lb female who is perfectly capable of submitting a 6’3” 225 lb man if he were to knock me to the ground and get on top of me. [Training in Jiu-Jitsu at UFC GYM](https://ufcgym.com/brazilian-jiu-jitsu) will leave women feeling the same way that I do, confident that I can defend myself against an attacker using the techniques I have learned throughout my training.\n\nOverall Health\n--------------\n\nBJJ is good for the mind, body, and soul. Unfortunately, a sedentary lifestyle has become the norm for modern society. Much of our day is spent sitting, whether it be behind the wheel, at a desk, or in front of some sort of monitor. BJJ is a great way to get your body limber, increase flexibility, improve strength, burn calories, and use your brain, all while relieving stress! The close body contact of the sport promotes awareness, focus, and a sense of euphoria. You are forced to be mindful and present in the moment. Trust me, it’s pretty hard to be distracted by the things that are stressing you out in life when your opponent is on top of you, trying to take one of your limbs. Jiu Jitsu is a mentally compelling combat sport. Learning a new technique requires as much (and sometimes even more) brain power than movement. This is why BJJ is sometimes called ‘the human chess match’. You must always think steps ahead to catch your opponent. The overall benefits to not only your body, but your mind is a key reason Jiu Jitsu is beneficial for women.\n\nCamaraderie\n-----------\n\nIt’s awesome having friends that you can roll with one minute and hug the next! Upon entering the world of BJJ, I was amazed to see the tightly knit, strongly supported community that has developed around it. There is a true sisterhood between the women who practice Jiu Jitsu. The bond that forms between the people you grapple with is a unique and unbreakable one. I have made some of my closest, lifelong friends thanks to this sport, not only through my training partners, but also with a few of the girls that I have competed against in tournaments. We are all in the sport to improve ourselves and each other, to empower one another, to set good examples for the girls in younger generations, and by breaking the norms of what society says woman is capable of and by showing what a strong female figure can be.  \n\nI could not imagine my life without BJJ. As women, it is our responsibility to be able to protect ourselves, our children, and our loved ones. It is our duty to stay healthy and strong and to promote a healthy lifestyle to those who look up to us. It is our duty to have fulfillment in our lives and have fun on our journey. If you’ve never been on the mats, I highly recommend changing that.

MMA has been an integral part of my life and shaped me into the woman I am today. My first experience on the mats was as a teenager, as a sophomore in highschool. My older neighbors were high school wrestlers and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners and their garage was matted out into a makeshift training room. I used to skateboard past their house every day and watch them grapple and I begged them to teach me and let me train with them. It took a few months of convincing, but finally they let me in. Before I knew it, my dad was paying the boys to teach me private lessons. This training sparked my love for mixed martial arts and I have continued to train in the sport since.

My son Jackson is almost 5, and daughter Cammie will be 2 in just a couple of months. Life is a whirlwind over here. My husband Brett, works in the food industry and travels between 30-50% of the time depending on the time of year. When travel is high, our time is precious, and our lives are beginning to transition to the next phase of school and sports. Having children has opened me up to a whole new set of experiences, and challenges in keeping some routines, and incorporating new ones.\n\nI got involved in the fitness industry when I was 18 and its been a part of my life ever since! I love being able to share our love of fitness with the kids, and seeing them flourish. Some of our most memorable time together as a family is spent putting down the phones and playing around, or exploring new places together. There are so many ways you can get together with the kids and work up a sweat, laugh, and bond without sacrificing your other obligations. Here are a few of my favorite ways to get my family moving:\n\nUFC GYM\n-------\n\nWe initially found [UFC GYM](https://ufcgym.com) about 2 and a half years ago, when a new location popped up not far from our house. I was skeptical at first, thinking it was just a fight gym for my husband, but boy was I wrong! The gym has opened us up to a whole new community and set of classes that are always changing and challenging. They even have a youth and family program that’s been amazing for us and for the kids. A great Saturday afternoon can be spent doing a [Family DUT class](https://ufcgym.com/classes/family-daily-ultimate-training-d-u-t) together with our son Jackson while Cammie spends time playing with her friends in kids club. I have never experienced anything like a Family DUT class at UFC GYM.  It not only teaches Jackson new movements and helps with his coordination, but gives him the chance to see Mom and Dad in action! I love having those moments together. He also gets inspired by seeing what the older kids can do, and wants to keep up! For days when I want some alone time while working our, or I just want some time to hit a bag, he can go to a [Youth Kickboxing](https://ufcgym.com/classes/youth-kickboxing) or [Brazilian Jujitsu class](https://ufcgym.com/classes/youth-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-gi), while I’m taking the adult version of the class in another area of the gym. Trying to find a class like that outside of the gym is expensive, and we have it right at our fingertips with UFC GYM without having to go elsewhere.\n\nOutside Activities\n------------------\n\nNice weather can bring some great adventures that the whole family can get involved in. Hiking, and bike rides are some really easy, and affordable options. My family packs up with water bottles, snacks, and a couple diapers and we are ready to go explore! Sometimes we visit a nearby park, other times we drive to a hiking location and just see how far we get. When someone gets tired it’s the perfect time for an impromptu picnic to catch up on how the week has been going. It gives us a chance to connect, get a couple fun photos to document the day, and have fun being active together. Hiking is an activitiy that you can enjoy with kids at any age, and who doesn’t love a great view?\n\nIndoor Activities\n-----------------\n\nSome days our schedule really gets crazy, and we don’t have time for an outing, but there’s always time for tag or hide and seek after bath time! The kids have a blast running around and we get a chance to chase out the last of their energy before bed. The kids sleep better, there’s less T.V time, and we all get more time to move around a bit more. Creativity can lend itself to some pretty fun games. One night we are monsters and the kids have to run or defeat us, other times we are knights and princesses, defending the couch castle! It keeps us in a child like state too which I miss… Adulting can be tiring! \n\n When I was young, my parents moved my brothers and I to North Dakota for a few years. The winters were no Joke! I remember spending A LOT of time playing in basements, playing make believe, jumping around, and just being silly. Forts or climbing areas can be made in any area of the house. You can take the cushions off the couch, or drape fabric over the dining table and run around doing “missions”. Plus, I don’t know about you guys, but its much easier for me to pick up a few cushions and fold a couple sheets after than to try and pick up a thousand Leggos off the ground or feel guilty about my son being glued to the T.V with a PlayStation remote or IPad in his hands.\n\nWalk it Out\n-----------\n\nLastly, if you have a restaurant within a mile of you, we try to plan at least a couple of times a month where we walk to dinner. Put the young ones in a stroller, or maybe if your children are older, they can skateboard or roller blade. Head to dinner and check the gear at the door. It’s a fun little switch to the regular routine and gets us out of the car for a change. Bonus- you’re working off a bit of the delicious diner you all just put down!\n\nThere are so many ways you can get up and get moving with the kiddos, but the main goal is just to make it fun.

Culinary skills were not a focus. In fact, my Master Degree thesis project was on the impact of phytosterols and a pedometer on cholesterol levels.

MMA has been an integral part of my life and shaped me into the woman I am today. My first experience on the mats was as a teenager, as a sophomore in highschool. My older neighbors were high school wrestlers and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners and their garage was matted out into a makeshift training room. I used to skateboard past their house every day and watch them grapple and I begged them to teach me and let me train with them. It took a few months of convincing, but finally they let me in. Before I knew it, my dad was paying the boys to teach me private lessons. This training sparked my love for mixed martial arts and I have continued to train in the sport since. In my opinion, every woman should practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at UFC GYM, and here are a few reasons why.\n\n#### EMPOWERMENT\n\nDo you have any idea how good it feels to physically stand your own against a man more than double your size? Jiu Jitsu was designed to use technique to overcome brute strength. A weaker and smaller opponent can dominate the big tough guy by using technique alone. Jiu Jitsu is the perfect sport for women, because we can use our body mechanisms to dominate our opponents, regardless of their strength and size. You don’t need to be big or strong to be good at it. BJJ teaches situational awareness, and how to properly disable and escape an attacker in a real-world defense situation. The scary fact is that 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted in the US. I love having the peace of mind, knowing that I am a 130 lb female who is perfectly capable of submitting a 6’3” 225 lb man if he were to knock me to the ground and get on top of me. Training in Jiu-Jitsu at UFC GYM will leave women feeling the same way that I do, confident that I can defend myself against an attacker using the techniques I have learned throughout my training.\n\n#### OVERALL HEALTH\nBJJ is good for the mind, body, and soul. Unfortunately, a sedentary lifestyle has become the norm for modern society. Much of our day is spent sitting, whether it be behind the wheel, at a desk, or in front of some sort of monitor. BJJ is a great way to get your body limber, increase flexibility, improve strength, burn calories, and use your brain, all while relieving stress! The close body contact of the sport promotes awareness, focus, and a sense of euphoria. You are forced to be mindful and present in the moment. Trust me, it’s pretty hard to be distracted by the things that are stressing you out in life when your opponent is on top of you, trying to take one of your limbs. Jiu Jitsu is a mentally compelling combat sport. Learning a new technique requires as much (and sometimes even more) brain power than movement. This is why BJJ is sometimes called ‘the human chess match’. You must always think steps ahead to catch your opponent. The overall benefits to not only your body, but your mind is a key reason Jiu Jitsu is beneficial for women.\n\n#### CAMARADERIE\nIt’s awesome having friends that you can roll with one minute and hug the next! Upon entering the world of BJJ, I was amazed to see the tightly knit, strongly supported community that has developed around it. There is a true sisterhood between the women who practice Jiu Jitsu. The bond that forms between the people you grapple with is a unique and unbreakable one. I have made some of my closest, lifelong friends thanks to this sport, not only through my training partners, but also with a few of the girls that I have competed against in tournaments. We are all in the sport to improve ourselves and each other, to empower one another, to set good examples for the girls in younger generations, and by breaking the norms of what society says woman is capable of and by showing what a strong female figure can be.\n\nI could not imagine my life without BJJ. As women, it is our responsibility to be able to protect ourselves, our children, and our loved ones. It is our duty to stay healthy and strong and to promote a healthy lifestyle to those who look up to us. It is our duty to have fulfillment in our lives and have fun on our journey.

It is not a one size fits all formula, but there are a few basics for everyone to keep in mind.  The truth is, there is no magic fix to working out and dieting- small changes are key for long term results, and you really cannot out exercise a poor diet! Overall, performance comes down to not only diet, but lifestyle factors as well! At UFC GYM, we are committed to offering you classes that will challenge you and help you reach your fitness goals. But it doesn’t stop at the gym, it is important to fuel your body with proper nutrition to maximize your performance and allow you to get the most of your classes. Let’s break it down:\n \n##### Tip #1: Think of Food as Fuel\n \nPre and post workout meals are important in ensuring adequate performance- be sure to incorporate ALL food groups including lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, dairy, beans, legumes, nuts and seeds\n \n \n##### Pre-workout (About 45 min. to max 3 hrs):\n \nFocus on carbohydrates (ex: grains, fruit, honey) with a small amount of protein (ex: chicken, eggs, peanut butter). It shouldn\'t be too heavy of a meal, especially closer to 45 minutes out.\nExample meal- Banana and peanut butter, yogurt and fruit, rice cake and almond butter, hard boiled egg and a Clementine, oatmeal and a few nuts, 1/2 c grapes and 10 almonds\n \n##### During workout:\n \nStay Hydrated! Long periods of endurance training will require more carbohydrates, and may even require some refueling with simple carbohydrate sources during the workout.\n \n##### Immediate post workout snack:\n \nFocus on simple carbohydrate such as a small piece of fruit until you get your actual meal in, and don’t forget your DotFit aminos!\n \n##### Post-workout (1 hr. to max 2 hrs):\n\nYou want to focus on protein (aim for minimum 25 grams). Additionally, now is when you can add in some healthy fats and grains.\nExample meal: 3-4 oz grilled chicken breast, 1/2c sweet potato, 1/2 c spinach and 1/3 of an avocado.\n \n##### Tip #2: Think of Supplementation as an Insurance Plan\n \nWhile I always promote food first, supplements can be a back-up to fill in any nutritional gaps for optimal health. For example, if you do not eat 2-3 servings of fatty fish per week, a fish oil supplement can be beneficial for you. A multivitamin and probiotics are also great to fill in those nutritional gaps and get your gut health back on track. For athletic performance, amino acids can be helpful for performance and recovery, and can be consumed before, during, and after workouts! Depending on your specific needs, you may also need protein, calcium, etc. for your specific needs and goals.\n \n##### Tip #3: Hydration is Key\n \nHydration is extremely important in addition to diet, and specific needs for athletes depends on the variability in sweat rates for each person. Before working out, ensure you are hydrated. A good way to calculate how much you need to rehydrate is to weigh yourself before working out. Then after your workout, weigh yourself again. Typically, any "weight loss" in that time is actually water loss- so that is how much you need to rehydrate. Every 2.2 pounds lost is generally about 1 liter.\n\n##### Tip #4: Reset to Maximize Recovery\n\nSleep is crucial! You recover in your sleep, and an adequate amount of sleep can help prevent soreness so you are ready to crush your next workout! Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\nOverall, it is a bit of a balancing act, and sometimes getting in an adequate amount of nutrition requires some planning. These are some basic and crucial ways to maximize your performance, whether you are a beginning in the gym, to an athlete- to take you one step forward. So, next time you head to UFC GYM, make sure you’ve fueled your body with the right foods that will give you the energy you need, you are hydrated, and fully rested.

What would you tell them?\n \nUFC GYM is for everyone, youth and adults. Seriously! Our goal is to give everyone the experience of training like an MMA athlete and fighter, not necessarily to become one. Our class programs are divided into two categories: Fitness and Skill.\n \nIf you are looking to train like a fighter and have the opportunity to get in shape like MMA athletes, then the fitness classes such as Boxing Conditioning, Kickboxing Conditioning, Fight Fit and our HIIT class called DUT (Daily Ultimate Training) are the perfect fit for you.\n\nIf you are looking to get into MMA or advance your skill set, then the skill classes are the way to go. We offer Gi and No Gi BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), MMA Skills and Technique, Boxing Skills and Technique, and Kickboxing Skills and Technique classes.\n \nAt UFC GYM, we have the perfect family friendly environment where parents can bring their children and watch them grow in a multitude of martial art disciplines, while themselves being able to train. This creates a culture of fitness in the family.\n \n \n##### A fitness challenge we often hear is limited time to work out. If you only have 30 minutes in the gym, what is your go-to workout for maximum return in minimal time?   \n \nI would do a Full Body Circuit: 45 second sets with 15 second breaks, 2 minute rest x 5 rounds. \nFull Body Movement, Pull Movement, Push Movement, Lower body Movement, Core Movement. \n\nEvery muscle group is being worked and pushed to its breaking point. The goal is to push through the fifth and last round like it’s your first round. I make it feel like a five round Championship Fight. When you are finishing round three and there is nothing left in the tank, you look across at your opponent and he looks more tired than you, something happens, something switches inside your mind and those last two rounds don’t seem so impossible anymore. Determination is key, you just get up off the floor and go to work! \n \n##### Any trade secrets or go-to training tips for our members? How can they step up their game in the gym?\n \nNutrition, nutrition, nutrition. The gut is your second brain.  Everything you consume has an effect on how you will feel and perform. Get in the right nutrients and watch how quickly your body transforms into a well-oiled machine. \n\nSecondly, when your mind and body hit that point in your workout when you are ready to go home, set an alarm for 20 additional minutes and continue to workout till the time runs out. You will be very surprised how far you can push your body when you put your mind to it.\n \n##### You’re the Director of MMA and Fitness for UFC GYM Middle East. What’s the most popular class there? Any unique fitness trends?\n \nMMA in this part of the world is still a new concept. Everyone comes in saying they want to be like Khabib until they see a punch coming at them. We take it slow and make sure everyone who comes in gets a very good understanding of what we do and who we are. We start with the fitness side first and when our members are ready, we move on to the skill classes. Our most popular classes are DUT, Kickboxing Conditioning and, on the skill side, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. \n \nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is also extremely popular in the region and is considered one of the fastest growing sports in the United Arab Emirates supported by the Abu Dhabi government to ensure that its citizens are reaping the benefits (discipline, respect, strategy, self-confidence) as the Abu Dhabi government has made the sport mandatory in all schools, police and military. What an investment by the government for its people, I find this super cool! This movement by the government has also fueled our growth. It’s awesome to see our UFC GYM Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu family grow exponentially across the Middle East and to participate in grading ceremonies and competitions worldwide.\n \n##### Music and fitness are tightly connected. It’s great for hype and motivation, some people might skip their workout if they did not have music! Help us refresh our playlist. What are 3 workout songs you’re listening to right now? \n\nI am a DJ in my spare time and am learning how to produce music, so this is my favorite question. I am a Drum and Bass/Dubstep/Future Bass music fan. Three workout songs I like right now are Freak by Friction, Mumbai Power by Skrillex and Take It Up (Not You Dope Remix) By Wilkinson.\n \n##### With many surgeries and injuries in your past, what’s your favorite way to recover? Any safety tips to help prevent injuries?\n \nWhat is Recovery? Ha ha. Unfortunately, that word did not exist in my vocabulary, which was the biggest mistake in my career. Best tip I can give anyone regarding this is listen to your body. It is always talking to you and letting you know what is going on. Foam roll and dynamic stretch before every workout. Make sure your body is ready for the battle you are about to go through.  Cryotherapy, massage therapy, physiotherapy are all very helpful tools to make sure your body can heal and perform at its highest level and prevent any injuries that may occur.\n \n##### With a UFC event almost every weekend, there's always an exciting fight match up to look forward to. What do you think gives athletes the winning edge?\n \n As an ex UFC athlete, it’s all about the heart and mind and always will be. Can you push your body and take it to a place that it has never been before on a daily basis? Can you push through the most challenging environment you have ever been in not only physically but mentally and not break and not give up?\n",html:"<p>We sat down with Krzysztof Soszynski, Director of MMA and Fitness for UFC GYM Middle East, to talk fitness challenges and trends, training tips and more.</p>\n<p>Currently based in Dubai, Krzysztof is a former UFC Light Heavyweight Contender and he holds NASM, Kettlebell and TRX certifications.

A lot of people wonder about this process, whether it’s because they enjoy watching the fights, want to compare their own training, or dream of making it as a fighter too.</strong></p> \n\nCS: When I train for a fight or when I prep for a fight it comes in stages. The initial stage is about 4 weeks of just getting in shape, eating a little better – I still do cheat days or cheat meals – but it’s kind of prepping my body for taking it to the next level. Then I try to do 6-8 weeks of intense between 1-3 practices a day with 2 days off a week and making sure I take my body to its limits, and then pull it back, and then doing that repeatedly until I’m ready for the fight. The closer I get to the fight , the less cheat meals I’m taking and the more things I’m cutting out of my diet so that way I’m not mentally strained from like 10 weeks out.\n\n\n##### UFC GYM: Is recovery a part of your training plan? Any tips?\nCS: Recovery is huge especially, I’m 35, I’ve been doing this for 15 years and so recovery is everything. Sleep, number one. I have to have at least 8 hours of sleep. And then I have all kinds of tools at my house I’ve built up. I have massaging machines, I have cupping tools, I have ice packs, I have heating pads. I go to cryotherapy, I get massages. I do everything that I need to do to make sure that I’m back to 100%. One thing that bums me out is alcohol. Alcohol actually slows your recovery process, your sleeping. Having a wine or beer before I go to bed is not going to help. So cutting things out like that.\n\n##### UFC GYM: Putting your body through grueling workouts, dedicating a lot of time to training, especially as you get closer to a fight, where do you find motivation?\n\nCS: For me, my motivation has always been trying to beat the guy that I was yesterday, or last month, or last year. So I’m always comparing myself to- how did I feel last camp? Or when I had my best performance- how did I feel, what was I doing? And trying to either recreate that or beat that. Myself. That’s my biggest opponent. Looking in the mirror. As long as I can be better than the guy yesterday, I’m still growing.\n\n\n##### UFC GYM: Most of us can only dream about it. Can you tell us what it’s like to enter the Octagon for a fight?\n\nCS: Stepping into the Octagon can be any emotion cause it depends where you’re at, but you’re also gonna be feeling different ones. Your gonna feel excited. You’re gonna be like Hell Yeah I’ve been working so hard for this. You can feel pressure. You can feel not wanted. You could be boo’d by 20,000 people. So, you could be feelin’ all types of things.

A lot of people wonder about this process, whether it’s because they enjoy watching the fights, want to compare their own training, or dream of making it as a fighter too.**\n\nCS: When I train for a fight or when I prep for a fight it comes in stages. The initial stage is about 4 weeks of just getting in shape, eating a little better – I still do cheat days or cheat meals – but it’s kind of prepping my body for taking it to the next level. Then I try to do 6-8 weeks of intense between 1-3 practices a day with 2 days off a week and making sure I take my body to its limits, and then pull it back, and then doing that repeatedly until I’m ready for the fight.

Any tips?** \n\nCS: Recovery is huge especially, I’m 35, I’ve been doing this for 15 years and so recovery is everything. Sleep, number one. I have to have at least 8 hours of sleep. And then I have all kinds of tools at my house I’ve built up. I have massaging machines, I have cupping tools, I have ice packs, I have heating pads. I go to cryotherapy, I get massages. I do everything that I need to do to make sure that I’m back to 100%.  One thing that bums me out is alcohol. Alcohol actually slows your recovery process, your sleeping. Having a wine or beer before I go to bed is not going to help. So cutting things out like that.\n\n<br>\n\n**UFC GYM: Putting your body through grueling workouts, dedicating a lot of time to training, especially as you get closer to a fight, where do you find motivation?**\n\nCS: For me, my motivation has always been trying to beat the guy that I was yesterday, or last month, or last year. So I’m always comparing myself to- how did I feel last camp? Or when I had my best performance- how did I feel, what was I doing? And trying to either recreate that or beat that. Myself. That’s my biggest opponent. Looking in the mirror. As long as I can be better than the guy yesterday, I’m still growing.\n\n<br>\n\n**UFC GYM: Most of us can only dream about it. Can you tell us what it’s like to enter the Octagon for a fight?**\n\nCS: Stepping into the Octagon can be any emotion cause it depends where you’re at, but you’re also gonna be feeling different ones. Your gonna feel excited. You’re gonna be like Hell Yeah I’ve been working so hard for this. You can feel pressure. You can feel not wanted. You could be boo’d by 20,000 people. So, you could be feelin’ all types of things.

The fundraising campaign runs January 11 through February 8 at participating UFC GYM locations throughout the United States. The launch will be marked with an appearance by Augie’s Quest co-founders, Augie and Lynne Nieto, at UFC GYM Torrance (19800 Hawthorne Boulevard, Torrance, CA 90503) on January 11. \n\nUFC GYM’s decision to partner with Augie’s Quest supports the brand’s mission to ‘Empower the Fighting Spirit’ in all members, from the fight for improved individual health and fitness, to bringing the community together to fight against ALS. There is also a close connection in the fitness community. Augie Nieto, a fitness industry pioneer and founder of Life Fitness, was diagnosed with ALS in 2005 and has since made it his mission to find a cure for the disease that affects far too many people today, robbing them of their muscles and every benefit that exercise provides. \n\n“ALS robs people of everything fitness and exercise provides, including strength and mobility,” says Augie Nieto, Co-Founder and Chairman of Augie’s Quest to Cure ALS.  The fitness industry icon who has lived with an ALS diagnosis for 15 years, continued “We are incredibly grateful to have UFC GYM as a new national partner, willing to Shred to Fight ALS. ALS doesn’t stand a fighting chance.”\n\n“Augie has been one of my biggest inspirations and I am so proud that UFC GYM is coming together to support the fight against this ugly disease. Our community is second to none when it comes to supporting one another, and we’re putting that support behind the fight to end ALS. UFC GYM empowers our members to fight against their personal health and fitness challenges on a daily basis, and we’re proud to provide an opportunity for our community to unite and fight together against a good cause like ending ALS,” said Adam Sedlack, President of UFC GYM. “As often stated by Augie’s wife, Lynne, ‘ALS is not an incurable disease, but rather an underfunded one,’ and we have the power to help change that.”\n\nDuring the campaign, UFC GYM is raising money by hosting a New Year’s resolution 4-week weight loss challenge, “The Shred to End ALS.” The weight loss challenge includes three personal training sessions. A portion of proceeds from “The Shred to End ALS” will be donated to Augie’s Quest. In addition, UFC GYM staff are challenging their members and each other to donate at least $1 when they take one of UFC GYM’s unique MMA-inspired fitness classes. All donations will go to Augie’s Quest in support of initiatives including the fast-track of cure-driven drugs, like the promising AT-1501. This drug just successfully completed Phase 1 Clinical Trials and has now moved to Phase 2, marking the first time a non-profit has progressed a drug so far, from inception to clinical trials.\n\n#### LAUNCH EVENT, SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 2020\nUFC GYM is launching their campaign to support the fight against ALS with a special event at UFC GYM Torrance, CA on Saturday, January 11.

The fundraising campaign runs January 11 through February 8 at participating UFC GYM locations throughout the United States. The launch will be marked with an appearance by Augie’s Quest co-founders, Augie and Lynne Nieto, at UFC GYM Torrance (19800 Hawthorne Boulevard, Torrance, CA 90503) on January 11.</p>\n<p>UFC GYM’s decision to partner with Augie’s Quest supports the brand’s mission to ‘Empower the Fighting Spirit’ in all members, from the fight for improved individual health and fitness, to bringing the community together to fight against ALS. There is also a close connection in the fitness community. Augie Nieto, a fitness industry pioneer and founder of Life Fitness, was diagnosed with ALS in 2005 and has since made it his mission to find a cure for the disease that affects far too many people today, robbing them of their muscles and every benefit that exercise provides.</p>\n<p>“ALS robs people of everything fitness and exercise provides, including strength and mobility,” says Augie Nieto, Co-Founder and Chairman of Augie’s Quest to Cure ALS.  The fitness industry icon who has lived with an ALS diagnosis for 15 years, continued “We are incredibly grateful to have UFC GYM as a new national partner, willing to Shred to Fight ALS. ALS doesn’t stand a fighting chance.”</p>\n<p>“Augie has been one of my biggest inspirations and I am so proud that UFC GYM is coming together to support the fight against this ugly disease. Our community is second to none when it comes to supporting one another, and we’re putting that support behind the fight to end ALS. UFC GYM empowers our members to fight against their personal health and fitness challenges on a daily basis, and we’re proud to provide an opportunity for our community to unite and fight together against a good cause like ending ALS,” said Adam Sedlack, President of UFC GYM. “As often stated by Augie’s wife, Lynne, ‘ALS is not an incurable disease, but rather an underfunded one,’ and we have the power to help change that.”</p>\n<p>During the campaign, UFC GYM is raising money by hosting a New Year’s resolution 4-week weight loss challenge, “The Shred to End ALS.” The weight loss challenge includes three personal training sessions. A portion of proceeds from “The Shred to End ALS” will be donated to Augie’s Quest. In addition, UFC GYM staff are challenging their members and each other to donate at least $1 when they take one of UFC GYM’s unique MMA-inspired fitness classes. All donations will go to Augie’s Quest in support of initiatives including the fast-track of cure-driven drugs, like the promising AT-1501. This drug just successfully completed Phase 1 Clinical Trials and has now moved to Phase 2, marking the first time a non-profit has progressed a drug so far, from inception to clinical trials.</p>\n<h4>LAUNCH EVENT, SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 2020</h4>\n<p>UFC GYM is launching their campaign to support the fight against ALS with a special event at UFC GYM Torrance, CA on Saturday, January 11.

Aim to fuel your body with nutrient dense foods and if you must have an alcoholic beverage, only consume it occasionally in small amounts.\n\n- **Get Plenty of Sleep.** Sleep is extremely important for good mental, emotional and physical health.

It’s important to realize that the scale reading may not accurately reflect your progress, such as changes in your body composition.

One of the most critical aspects of preparing for a fitness challenge is staying hydrated. Hydration is essential to replenish your body during any high intensity fitness activities, but especially the Ultimate Fitness Challenge. Dehydration can negatively impact your mood making you feel anxious, exhausted, and unfocused. Drink plenty of water to keep your energy up to get through these rigorous workouts!\n2. FOOD. While consistently working out is helpful for training, eating nourishing foods have an even greater impact on performance. It may seem daunting to prepare nutritious meals, but meal prepping can help take some of the pressure off and set you up for success. Preparing your meals ahead of time will help with the temptation to eat non-nutrient dense foods and have you feeling your best during the challenge.\n3. MENTAL PREPARATION. Even with food prep and staying hydrated, the fitness challenge can be intimidating to even the best of athletes. Our goal for the Ultimate Fitness Challenge is to have fun and bring you out of your comfort zone! To stay motivated and pumped for the challenge, we recommend you create a fun playlist to listen to while you work out, set reasonable goals for yourself and do the best you can.\n4. REST. Lastly, make sure to schedule those rest days; they are the most crucial aspect for keeping your body healthy and building muscle! Rest helps your body recover and prepare for the next workout, while assisting is critical muscle repair. Have a hard time carving out a rest day or two? Book a recovery session with your trainer or visit the Recovery area to experience a Hyperice percussion massage or Normatec compression therapy.\n5. WHAT TO BRING TO THE CHALLENGE.

We’ve spoken with just a couple of our world class trainers on their suggested tips for competing in this years challenge and how partcipating in the challenge, you will have the opportunity to learn some new skills.\n\n###### Jhanex Alviz - MMA Coach\n\nJhanex Alviz is an experienced MMA Coach at our UFC FIT Point Loma location. Jhanex says that the key to competing is to keep in mind the competition is not about winning or losing but competing with yourself. She hopes that our members will be able to push themselves to new heights creating confidence and mental toughness within themselves.\n\nAnother piece of advice Jhanex offers is not to overtrain your body, but to listen to it, and recover after training. Finding a balance between recovery and training is essential to performing well. At UFC FIT & UFC GYM, we have recovery centers that offer cryotherapy, compression massage therapy, and percussion massage therapy (locations may vary).\n\nOne of the most impactful parts of participating in the challenge, Jhanex notes, are the formed connections with members. It is a place to push your body to new limits, learn from our best coaches, and make great memories at UFC GYM!\n\n###### Gabe Sanchez - Fitness Manager\n\nSome other tips for the challenge come from Gabe Sanchez. Gabe is one of our fitness managers at UFC's FIT Anaheim GardenWalk and the Coach's Champion of 2019 Ultimate Fitness Challenge. One of the few reasons Gabe encourages his members to join the challenge is that instead of just day-to-day training, it provides a sense of purpose because you are training to perform. When preparing for the challenge, you get out of your comfort zone, can showcase aspects of your workout routine and receive assistance from a coach who can help you learn new skills and how to better your exercise form.\n\nHis key to success and best words of advice to members participating in the challenge is \"Eat well, perform well.\" Nutrition is essential, and eating a balanced diet could help you to reach your goals.  \n\nGabe notes the best aspect is the camaraderie that comes from participating.

We’ve spoken with just a couple of our world class trainers on their suggested tips for competing in this years challenge and how partcipating in the challenge, you will have the opportunity to learn some new skills.</p>\n<h6>Jhanex Alviz - MMA Coach</h6>\n<p>Jhanex Alviz is an experienced MMA Coach at our UFC FIT Point Loma location. Jhanex says that the key to competing is to keep in mind the competition is not about winning or losing but competing with yourself. She hopes that our members will be able to push themselves to new heights creating confidence and mental toughness within themselves.</p>\n<p>Another piece of advice Jhanex offers is not to overtrain your body, but to listen to it, and recover after training. Finding a balance between recovery and training is essential to performing well. At UFC FIT &amp; UFC GYM, we have recovery centers that offer cryotherapy, compression massage therapy, and percussion massage therapy (locations may vary).</p>\n<p>One of the most impactful parts of participating in the challenge, Jhanex notes, are the formed connections with members. It is a place to push your body to new limits, learn from our best coaches, and make great memories at UFC GYM!</p>\n<h6>Gabe Sanchez - Fitness Manager</h6>\n<p>Some other tips for the challenge come from Gabe Sanchez. Gabe is one of our fitness managers at UFC's FIT Anaheim GardenWalk and the Coach's Champion of 2019 Ultimate Fitness Challenge. One of the few reasons Gabe encourages his members to join the challenge is that instead of just day-to-day training, it provides a sense of purpose because you are training to perform. When preparing for the challenge, you get out of your comfort zone, can showcase aspects of your workout routine and receive assistance from a coach who can help you learn new skills and how to better your exercise form.</p>\n<p>His key to success and best words of advice to members participating in the challenge is &quot;Eat well, perform well.&quot; Nutrition is essential, and eating a balanced diet could help you to reach your goals.</p>\n<p>Gabe notes the best aspect is the camaraderie that comes from participating. Members feel connected and create long-lasting relationships with not only their team but with UFC GYM's amazing coaches!</p>\n<p>UFC GYM is here to support our members with their goals and have memorable experiences in our Ultimate Fitness Challenge at UFC GYM.

Plus, he’s TRX certified, Rockblade certified, and an avid runner! Keep reading for his insights.\n\n**UFC GYM:** So, what are those best exercises that everyone should do?\n\n**VA:** Everyone has different training goals and individual needs and preferences. The answer that is likely the most correct is – whatever you find enjoyable enough to do consistently without injury. However, I’ll do my best to breakdown some of the best typical movement patterns to include in an exercise program for an average person. In general, most good programs will consist of five main movement patterns which are: Squats, Pushes, Pulls, Hinges, and Carries.\n\nLet’s break these down more specifically.\n\n* **Squats:** The squat movement pattern is self-explanatory, though there are lots of variations. The most typical examples are going to be a standard barbell back squat or a body weight squat.\n\n  These are primarily designed to target your quad muscles on the front of your leg, but like any good movement, they train a lot more than that. Squats also utilize your glutes, hamstrings, and core muscles, and overall, these are some of the best lower body exercises to do.\n  \n  Some additional variations include goblet squats, split squats, lunges, step ups, front squat, wall-sits, and box squats. These all mimic a similar movement pattern to a standard squat, but none are inherently more challenging or easier. In general, start with a bodyweight squat or a wall-sit until your leg and core strength can handle increased loads. People with knee injuries such as ACL/MCL tears or damaged meniscus should avoid most of these.\n\n* **Pushes:** Pushes typically come in two forms, horizontal and vertical, aka chest presses and overhead presses. These are typically done to strength and shape up the chest, shoulder, and triceps muscles.\n\n  Some variations include barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press, incline barbell/dumbbell bench press, military press, dumbbell overhead press, and pushups. In general people with shoulder injuries or pain in the shoulder joints should avoid these as they are likely to cause further injury. Outside of that, most everyone can perform these movements. Be sure to start with something easier like a pushup on your knees or against a wall before getting more advanced.\n\n* **Pulls:** Pulls also typically come in both horizontal and vertical forms. These movements strengthen up the muscles of the back such as the rhomboids and lats. These are important muscles to strengthen for day-to-day life. A strong back is going to greatly assist in good posture and less spinal pain.\n\n  Some pulling movements are barbell/dumbbell rows, pullups, lat pulldowns, and shrugs. In general, doing bodyweight pullups are a difficult exercise and most people will have to start with something easier such as a lat pulldown until they are strong enough to move their own bodyweight.  These are some of the safest movements to perform in general because the weights are not on top of you for almost any pulling movement. People with shoulder or elbow injuries may experience some discomfort doing some of these movements, but otherwise everyone is likely to be able to do these.\n\n* **Hinges:** I feel these are some of the most underutilized and over demonized movements in the fitness world. These include exercises like deadlifts, good mornings, hip thrusts, and kettlebell swings.\n  These are very important exercises to strength your entire body, primarily working your hamstrings, glutes, core, and back. Deadlifts will also help prepare someone well for day-to-day tasks such as picking up groceries or moving furniture around.\n  \n  Some of these movements get a bad rep as dangerous for your back, but this simply isn’t true when done correctly with good form and appropriate weights. If anything, these are the best movements you can do for long term injury prevention as they will develop full body strength and coordination. People with spinal injuries should avoid most of these, and they may aggravate things like sciatica. Start with light weights such as small dumbbells or a light kettlebell before working up into heavier loads. Work with a professional trainer for support on form and safety.\n\n* **Carries:** Without a doubt these are the most underutilized exercises. This is unfortunate because they are likely also the most “functional.” I mean this is the literal sense, as an average person picks things up and carries them around all day.\n\n  These movements include farmer’s carries, waiter’s walks, suitcase carries, overhead carries, or really any exercise where you are walking under load. These movements will strengthen your core, specifically obliques for many of them which help tighten people’s waists up, and the stronger your core, the less chance you have of being injured.\n\n  For athletes these are very important as most of your power will come from your core, and this translates well into basically every sport. Essentially everyone can do some from of weighted carry, and they are very low risk of injury though people with weak grip strength will need to make sure they can hold onto the weights they are trying to use.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTrain with Vince at [UFC GYM Torrance](https://bit.ly/3PuOD0P)\n\nExplore [Personal Training](https://bit.ly/3MwDLOg) or contacting a [gym near you](https://bit.ly/3Mxm555).\n",html:'<p>We caught up with one of our Fitness Directors, Vincent Angeli, to dig into a question that often pops up when gym-goers are assessing their fitness goals and how to reach them – What are the best exercises that everyone should do?</p>\n<p>Vince oversees the fitness program at UFC GYM Torrance, California, is a Certified Personal Trainer through ACSM for 6+ years and holds a Bachelor\'s degree in Biology from Cornell University.

UFC® named CryoBuilt the official cryotherapy of UFC Performance Institute®.\n\nKeep reading to explore six benefits you might enjoy from regular usage of cryotherapy.\n\n#### 1. LOSING FAT / BOOSTING METABOLISM\n\nIndividuals that work in colder temperatures or outside are shown to have more brown fat. A Nature Journal Scientific report found evidence that at lower temperatures our cells produce a certain kind of fat known as brown fat. Cold weather then activates the brown fats, which in turn break down blood sugar and fat molecules to generate heat in order to maintain your body temperature. The brown fats that are activated lead to various metabolic changes in the body.\n\nBrown fat is essentially mitochondria-dense white fat – just 10 consecutive cryotherapy sessions can increase your mitochondria count by about 38%.\n\nA higher metabolism burns more calories while resting to stay warm in cold temperatures. Repeated exposure to colder temperatures boosts metabolism because your body is trying to warm itself. Revving up the metabolism is also how babies regulate their body temperature since they don’t have the muscles to shiver themselves warm. Over time, as your metabolism increases, your body will burn more calories both at rest and during activity. Plus, some people feel a rush of energy right after cryotherapy, which may lead to increased exercise.\n\n#### 2. REDUCED INFLAMMATION\n\nAs mentioned in this previous articles regarding the Vagus Nerve, stimulating this nerve helps prevent inflammation through the presence of the tumor necrosis factor. This alerts the brain and draws out anti-inflammatory neurotransmitters that regulate the body’s immune response. A study found patients who received Whole Body Cryotherapy (WBC) sessions showed considerably lower Rheumatoid Arthritis levels when compared to patients who received only physical therapy.\n\nCryotherapy reduces the inflammatory process by decreasing the macrophage infiltration and the accumulation of the inflammatory key markers. This is one reason the world's top athletes and professional sports franchises use cryotherapy as a key mode of recovery. These benefits are accomplished by stimulating the Vagus Nerve. Delve deeper into the details in this dedicated article explaining how the Vagus Nerve is effected by Cryotherapy.\n\n#### 3. PREVENTING DEMENTIA\n\nThe most common form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality in aging demographics. It has been found that vascular alteration, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses contribute to the development of Alzheimer's Disease. These aspects of the disease have also been shown to be affected by cryotherapy.\n\nIn studies of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, the oxidative stress that occurs in the development of dementia has been shown to be lowered by cryotherapy. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effect of cryostimulation as well as hormonal and lipid changes may play a role in preventing pathophysiological processes leading to dementia.\n\nIn addition, during WBC, inflammatory cytokines are released. They cross the blood brain barrier which reduces chronic inflammation in the brain. Clinical trials involving patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis showed them to have a statistically significant increase in the total antioxidant status following 10 cryotherapy sessions (Miller 2010). Due to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effect of low temperatures as well as the hormonal and lipid changes it causes, WBC may play a significant role in preventing or inhibiting processes leading to dementia.\n\n#### 4. REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION\n\nA small study performed in 2008 divided patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. The study group in the experiment were treated with 15 routine visits to the cryotherapy chamber plus standard psychopharmacotherapy. After three weeks of testing, the groups then used a Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and Hamilton’s anxiety rating scale (HARS) to measure their outcomes. Though a bigger sample size needs to be tested upon, the results based on this experiment suggest patients who used WBC had lower scores in the HDRS and HARS.\n\nAnother aspect of exposing the body to such cold temperatures is that it causes the body to release endorphins and natural adrenaline. This gets the blood flowing, which can be helpful to people experiencing anxiety and depression. This could explain that euphoric feeling after stepping out of a session.\n\nStudies performed in Poland treating WBC as an adjunct treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders showed more improvement for the group exposed to WBC when compared to a group that was not exposed. The endorphins produced, combined with the sleeping benefits which help create a natural sleep, strongly suggest that repetitive cryotherapy can positively impact mental health. Following a session, people have experienced feelings of euphoria and an energy high lasting for hours.\n\n#### 5. TREATING MIGRAINE HEADACHES\n\nCold therapy for headaches goes back around 150 years. Migraines impact millions of people worldwide. In a study done by University of Hawai’i, participants’ carotid arteries at the neck were targeted with cold therapy for migraine relief. The findings of this study demonstrated significant reduction of pain in participants with migraine headaches when they were treated with cold therapy as compared to the control group.\n\nStimulating the back of the neck during cryotherapy can help numb the nerves and can significantly reduce migraine pain. Cooling and numbing can help in constricting the blood vessels which then helps reduce the neurotransmission to the brain. A headache solution that has transcended from using ice with salt has now transformed into a precise and effective method with cryotherapy.\n\n#### 6. YOUNGER-LOOKING SKIN\n\nCryotherapy sessions can boost collagen which helps to reduce the appearance of visible lines and wrinkles in the skin. Increased collagen can help improve skin volume and resiliency while reducing the appearance of pores and promoting smoother looking skin. The increase in collagen plays a part in recurring the visibility of cellulite and fatty deposits under the skin. WBC works by stimulating cell growth and cell renewal which in turn rejuvenates the whole body. This can result in repairing skin that might previously have been damaged and ultimately younger looking skin.\n\nWhen you step out of a cryo session, the blood surges back from your core to your extremities. The blood brings back nutrients, antioxidants, and oxygen to the entire body. This boost in circulation can help improve skin tone, reduce dark circles, and may even promote the growth of hair as well as fingernails.\n\n[Article Source](https://www.cryobuilt.com/post/6-things-to-expect-from-cryotherapy/)\n",html:'<p>Curious about the benefits of cryotherapy?

Keep reading to learn more about his path to losing over 100 pounds.\n\n**UFC GYM: What made you start your fitness journey?**\n\n**BH:** My journey started about 6 years ago at 300 pounds. I was a club promoter – hosting and late nights were my job. This led to very unhealthy habits such as late-night eating, alcohol and smoking.\n\nIn my early 30's I was not happy who I saw in the mirror. I definitely wasn't happy who I saw in pictures. One day it just hit me after seeing a picture of myself – I just looked very unhealthy and overweight.\n\nI always thought myself to be bigger, but never \"out of shape\". The very next day I was heading out to work, I put a shirt on that was always a little bigger, as I was buttoning it up, I couldn't button it as before. This was disheartening but I still went on my way to work.\n\nThe next morning, I decided to step on the scale, now mind you I haven't been on a scale since near since high school for wrestling. As I went to the dreaded scale, I was thinking I was 260 maybe 270. This isn't a spoiler, but it was shocking to see myself at 300 pounds.\n\nWhat was I to do? Where do I even begin? What is my future? How did I let myself go this much? All of these questions ran thru my head. I was embarrassed, I immediately knew I had to change to see any type of future and positivity in my life.\n\n**UFC GYM: What goals did you set for yourself and what challenges did you face throughout your journey to a healthier lifestyle?**\n\n**BH:** I made a goal for 2 months no drinking so I can have ZERO excuses to miss the gym. The start was rough, I lost so much strength and stamina. I was feeling weak, I was still feeling embarrassed. I had to push through it and trust the process that brighter days were ahead.\n\nIn a few weeks I developed a better sleep schedule, workout routine, and started putting healthy foods in my body and the biggest thing was NO DRINKING and BOOM, just like that my mind started believing. It's funny what happens to the mind and body once you believe!\n\nEverything around me started to just get better, overall quality of life. I'm talking about baby steps, not an overnight miracle. Once 2 months was over, I lost 60 pounds, and 3 more months go by and I'm still at 60 pounds. Now where do I go? Is this the best I can get myself to do?\n\n**UFC GYM: How did you get involved with UFC GYM?**\n\n**BH:** After my plateau, I remembered a friend who worked for UFC GYM that always encouraged me to come in. I never did because I thought I was just too old for MMA. However, my workout partner said let's go and try it. So of course, we did.\n\nMy first class was with Coach Derrick and it was a DUT/HIIT class. I was nervous beyond belief walking in, but I knew I needed another level of challenges. Joe and I completed our first UFC GYM class and I was hooked!\n\nMy weight loss journey continued in those months after starting at the gym and I lost another 20 pounds.\n\n**UFC GYM: What led you from your first class to a career with UFC GYM?**\n\n**BH:** The same friend who worked for the gym told me a spot for sales manager or GM will be open at the Orland location and that I should give it a try. For about 1 month I said no, not because I didn't want to, but because I was scared of the unknown of leaving my company and industry.\n\nI started to cut my promotion company days down, started to cut venues down and figuring out how to jungle both at the same time. In doing that I realized both jobs were very similar. At the end of the day, it's hospitality, it's being good with people, it's about helping others and meeting new people. After 2 or 3 months of working and reading all the material there was to train my mind on the UFC GYM culture, I was offered the general manager position. This was truly the start of my life!\n\n**UFC GYM: Any final advice?**\n\n**BH:** This is my story and I hope my story finds someone who needs it and helps change their fight, in a positive way. I also want you to know that it's never too late to start.\n  \nI also want to share what I call my \"Big 3\" from my fitness journey:\n\n1. I was able to reduce my weight from 300 pounds to 200 pounds and lower my body fat from 36.8% to 11.4% thru the motivation and experience of my coaches.\n\n2. I was able to truly meet the love of my life Cindy, who now is my wife. Cindy and I worked different UFC GYM locations and it's this company that brought us together. She changed my life even more than I ever did.\n\n3. Recently, Cindy and I had a UFC GYM baby. His name is Saint and he is our greatest accomplishment and blessing.\n\nEverything I have or did to this point in my life was all because of that shirt that didn't fit. Was because I decided I needed to change!
